 * WARNING: You should avoid using leaf values that are 64 bytes long prior to

 *
 * IMPORTANT: Consider memory side-effects when using custom hashing functions
 * that access memory in an unsafe way.
 *
 * NOTE: This library supports proof verification for merkle trees built using
 * custom _commutative_ hashing functions (i.e. `H(a, b) == H(b, a)`). Proving
